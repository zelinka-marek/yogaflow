The app is useful for practicing yoga exercises. Use beginner-friendly yoga asanas to get your body toned and increase flexibility.

## Technologies<a name="technologies"></a>

The app is made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (using ES6 and hooks), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling.

I've used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool. The app is deployed at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Goals<a name="goals"></a>

All my projects have a goal - something to practice. It can be a framework, a styling library, or a programming concept. In this one, I tried to put into practice my knowledge of React Router v6.
